### Digitization

Most maps of the Linguistic Survey of India (LSI) have been digitized in [LinguistLists'](https://linguistlist.org/)
LL-MAP project. The geo-data of this project is available as dataset

> LinguistList. (2023). linguistlist/LL-MAP: LL-MAP: Language and Location - A Map Annotation Project (v0.1) [Data set]. Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10008714

The associated map scans from LL-MAP have been geo-referenced by Robert Forkel and are made available
with this dataset. Two maps have been geo-referenced and digitized based on the scans at the
[Digital South Asia Library](https://dsal.uchicago.edu/books/lsi/).

Glottocode assignments have been made based the ISO 639-3 codes provided in the LL-MAP data and on 
the related work in
